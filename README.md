# In2it Promo Coffee Cups

This repo was build to generate the code we used on the cups for [PHPBenelux Conference 2020](https://conference.phpbenelux.eu/) as a way to promote the work we do.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/in2it/promo-coffee-cup.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/in2it/promo-coffee-cup)

**INFO:** This promotion requires PHP 7.3 or higher.
